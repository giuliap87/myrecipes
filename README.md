## Getting Started

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

# Motivation 

The aim of this project is to get familiar with Next js and MongoDB.

## Description 

Create a collection of your favorite recipes. You can add your recipe in the "new recipe" section, all recipes are saved in our database and displayed in the "all recipes" section. In the "give me a recipe" section you can for now get one random recipe from the database. 

# Todos

My aim is actually build an application that will help me implement a weekly meal plan.
